# Gyèrmo

Gyèrmo is just a quick GUI tool to analyze JCR6 resource files, which can sometimes be handier than just going for CLI tools such as Jalondi.
Jalondi was a girl who plays a role in my novel "De Vleugels Des Oorlogs" and Gyèrmo is her boy-friend, and father of her child. So that explains the names of the two tools.

There's not much to it to understand Gyèrmo, it can only view entries and extract them. Unlike Jalondi Gyèrmo cannot be used to create JCR6 files.

Aside from JCR6, Gyèrmo also supports WAD (used in Doom, Heretic, Hexen, Rise of the Triad) and Quake's PAK files (only tested on Quake I. I do not know if Quake II uses a similar system or not). There's also limited support for TAR.

As I want to detach completely from .NET, Gyèrmo was set up to replace Stach, and Stach is therefore deprecated and discontinued. No updates for Stach should be expected.
